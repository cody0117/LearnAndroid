Customized UNIVERSAL template with Parse and Google Analytics (based on version 1.1)

1. Parse

To get parse to work, open Analytics.java (to be found in the top package)
and browse to: Parse.initialize(.....  
which should be somewhere around line 74)

Edit it (with the dummy values replaced):
Parse.initialize(this, "YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_KEY");

Parse is now set up

2. Analytics

Browse to and open the app_tracker and global_tracker xml files to be found in the res/xml folder

Browse and edit the string:
<string name="ga_trackingId">YOUR_TRACKING_ID</string>

Now open the Analytics.java file (to be found in the top package)
and browse to and edit the following line:

private static final String PROPERTY_ID = "YOUR_TRACKING_ID";

Analytics is now set up

3. Advanced Analytics

By default, only the app opens (mainactivity.java) and the Rss list activity (RssActivity are tracked), if you want to track other activities
(to be found in the com.universal.xxx.ui package) you should add the following line to the oncreate method:
 
        //Get a Tracker (should auto-report)
	  	((Analytics) getApplication()).getTracker(Analytics.TrackerName.APP_TRACKER);

And  the following code before the last } of a file (within the activity class). 

 @Override
    public void onStop() {
    	super.onStop();
    	GoogleAnalytics.getInstance(this).reportActivityStart(this);
    }
    	
    @Override
    public void onStart() {
    	super.onStart();
    	GoogleAnalytics.getInstance(this).reportActivityStop(this);
    }
    
Make sure to merge this code if there are already onstart & onstops present (you can only have 1), else, you should merge them (simply
only copy the googleanalytics.getinsta.... part and paste it to the existing method.

Again, for an example, you can look at the MainActivity or RssActivity classes
